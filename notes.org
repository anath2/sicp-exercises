* Structure and interpretation of computer programs

** Building abstractions with procedures

** Building abstractions with data
*** Complex numbers
There two possible ways to represent complex numbers. These include the

1. Polar form
2. Rectanglar form

The goal is to be able to create generic procedures that can operate on complex numbers
irrespective of the underlying representation of data. One of the ways to achieve this
is to attach a tag to each complex number indicating whether it represented in rectangular
or polar form. Then based on the tag call the appropriate procedure for selectors and
other arithematic operations
