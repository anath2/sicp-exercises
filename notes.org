* Structure and interpretation of computer programs

** Building abstractions with procedures

** Building abstractions with data
*** Complex numbers
There two possible ways to represent complex numbers. These include the

1. Polar form
2. Rectanglar form

The goal is to be able to create generic procedures that can operate on complex numbers
irrespective of the underlying representation. One of the ways to achieve this is to attach a tag to each
complex number indicating whether it represented in rectangular or polar form. Then based on the tag
call the appropriate procedure for selecting attributes or performing other other arithematic operations
**** Data directed programming
Here, the procedures are stored in a lookup table along with a tag signifying the name of the implementation.
The implementation is searched in the table when the procedure is called
