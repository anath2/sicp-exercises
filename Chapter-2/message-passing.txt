Comparing message passing with data directed style and explicit dispatch for writing

Q. Which among message passing, data directed programming and explicit dispatch on tag
would be appropriate in a large system where type often changes

Ans: explicit dispatch requires all function on datatypes to be names differently also,
constructors of the datatypes have tags that are to be added. Hence all functions have to modified
to ensure there is no conflict among when a new type is added. Adding new operations is simpler
since they only have to be added for given types.

Data directed programming makes it easier to add new types installed as packages. Adding additional
operations on types is cumbersome as all packages have to be modified. Same is true in message
passing style of objects
